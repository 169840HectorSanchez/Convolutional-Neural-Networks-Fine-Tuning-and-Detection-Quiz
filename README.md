# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Fine-Tuning-and-Detection-Quiz
Answers to the quiz 
## Only Use this if you can have doubts about the course. Don't cheat. I was having trouble with the course, so I did the exam many times.
## First try doing it yourself.

### Question 1
### Which of the following can be said about convolutional layers as opposed to full connected layers?
#### In general, convolutional layers have less parameters than a corresponding fully connected layer.
#### A fully connected layer can be treated as a convolutionallayer with one filter with filter size equal to the input size.
### Question 2
### Given a convolutional layer whose input is n by n with a padding of 1 and stride of 1, what filter size must be used to maintain the size of the input (so that the output is also n by n)?
#### 3
### Question 3
### When extracting features from a Convolutional Neural Network, in what case would a feature representation be useful?
#### Images are not linearly separable in the pixel space, but may be linearly separable in the feature space.
### Question 4
### When fine-tuning a Convolutional Neural Network, which of the following techniques is most effective?
#### Start by training a network with a very large dataset, and then modify and re-learn the last layer(s) with a smaller dataset after the network learns a mapping from pixels to a feature space.
### Question 5
### Which of the following statements is true regarding CNN architectures?
#### Generally, a CNN begins with alternating convolutional and pooling layers, followed by a few fully connected layers.
#### With each layer in the network, the number of filthers (the depth) generaally decreases.
### Question 6
### Localized max-pooling (stride-2) of the following matrix produces a matrix of what size? Enter your answer as "# by #"
#### 2 by 2
### Question 7
### What is the largest value produced by localized max-pooling (stride-2) of the following matrix?
#### 54
### Question 8
### What is the smallest value produced by localized max-pooling (stride-2) of the following matrix?
#### 11
